Coding Quiz Challange

## Description

The aim of this project was to utilize JavaScript and use the DOM to make a 
funtioning quiz that would give you a final score based on the time it took to complete all the questions (subtracting 10 seconds for each wrong answer).

query selectors and event listeners were used extensively to assign values to buttons and listen to see if they were clicked. 

It was a good opertunity to practice using these functions as well as reinforcing 
general js principles.
